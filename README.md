# A-star Pathfinding Visualiser
This is an implementation of the A* search algorithm, built in Python using the pygame module which helps to visualise the pathfinding algorithm as it runs. It allows you to pick the source and destination anywhere in the grid, place obstacles in between and visualise the entire process of finding the shortest path.

## Requirements
   - Python 3
   - pygame
